# Videos-In-Scratch
A python script that converts a video.mp4 into a text file, that can be played back as video in Scratch. This all works without costumes

# HOW TO USE
Make a folder somewhere on your computer

Store the python script and your MP4 video inside of that folder

Run the script through Visual Studio Code or Command Prompt

Just type in the video name (with .mp4 at the end), wait for the conversion to finish, and you now have "colors.txt"


# HOW TO PLAY IN SCRATCH
Download the VIDEO.sb3 file

Open the "VIDEO" list, and import the text file

You will not need to change any code. Just click the green flag

If you want to add your video's audio, just replace the sound in the SOUNDS tab
